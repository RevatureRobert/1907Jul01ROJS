/* 
I'm sure you have heard of java
    Javascript has nothing to do with java

    A few things
        it is a programming language
        it is a scripting language
        it is interpreted
            the browser will run js line by line
        It is loosely typed
        it is dynamic
*/

/* 
    js is loosely typed because variables can hold 
        and have transferred any datatype
    In js:
        x="fitty"
    in java:
        String x="fitty"
    in js:
        x=6;
    in java:
        NO X=6
*/


// x="sum sum"
/* 
    datatypes in js
        string, boolean, number, object, symbol, undefined, null
    different types of dattypes
        primitive
            number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol
        referenced
            object, function, array

////////////////////// what is a variable
// variables are placeholders that we can place our values in

////////////////// how do we declare a variable
// var, let, const, no_keyword
// var y=1;
// let z=2;
// const c=4;
// a=2;

///////////////operators
//  3 types of operators:
//      unary, binary, ternary
//  unary works with one operand
//  binary works with two operand
//  ternary works with three operand
/* 
unary
    !   returns the opposite boolean value
    ++x pre increment
    x++ post increment
    --x pre decrement
    x-- post decrement

binary
    +   addition
    -   subtraction
    *   multiplication
    /   division
    **  exponent
    %   modulus
    <   less than
    >   greater than
    <=  less than or equal to
    >=  greater than or equal to
    =   assignment
    x+=2  addition assignment
    -=  subtraction assignment
    *=  multiplication assignment
    /=  division assignment
